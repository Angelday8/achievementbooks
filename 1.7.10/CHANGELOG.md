- Added a complete migration support for SA
- Fixed crash on opening the book in b69
- Fixed a weird crash and restructured source loading 

Core functionality has moved out to a core module for easier porting to other versions.
From this point on, every change will be reflected in every version supported, not just the main
minecraft version.
