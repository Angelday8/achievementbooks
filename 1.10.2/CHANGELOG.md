Support for 1.10.2 is new and it's not without bugs.
Please if you find any, let me know asap.

- Sound engine is modified
- Texture loading is modified

There is a known bug when you load in a new book config, the item icon will appear to be missing.
Press `F3+T` to reload textures, and it should be ok.
