The very first release of Achievement Books.
This is still an early version, so expect limited capabilities and design.

It actually does what it is intended to do, so feel free to refer to the [project page](https://github.com/meza/achievementbooks) on how to use it.
Also, feedback, issues, pull requests are all appreciated. Let me know what you would want to see in this mod.

p.s.: 1.7+ support is coming very soon, watch this space.
