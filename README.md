# Achievement Books

The Achivement Books mod by @meza (vsbmeza on minecraft) introduces the ability to create multiple achievement books to Minecraft.

It is configurable via JSON to have headers, free flow text and achievement checklists on multiple pages.

#### Acknowledgment

This mod has been inspired by the Simple Achievements mod which has aided my journey into Minecraft, with Sky Factory.
Upon building my own modpack, I needed a bit more flexibility, hence a "simple" book wasn't enough.
